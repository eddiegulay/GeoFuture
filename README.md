# GeoFuture
NASA Space apps challenge


## Key Features and Functionalities

### Interactive Maps and Geospatial Data:
- Implement interactive maps using a library like Leaflet or Mapbox.
- Integrate geospatial data sources, including NASA Earth observation data, geological maps, and satellite imagery.

### Data Visualization:
- Create data visualization tools for geological data, such as rock layers, fault lines, mineral deposits, and topography.
- Provide various visualization options like contour maps, heatmaps, and 3D terrain models.

### Geological Analysis Tools:
- Develop tools for geological analysis, including identifying rock types, mineral composition, and geological features.
- Implement measurement and analysis tools for features like fault angles and dip angles.

### Data Integration:
- Integrate external geological databases and APIs to access geological data and research findings.
- Allow users to upload their own geological data for analysis.

### Geological Surveys:
- Enable users to conduct virtual geological surveys by selecting areas on the map and collecting geological data.
- Provide tools for creating geological cross-sections and stratigraphic columns.

### Data Filtering and Search:
- Implement filters and search functionality to help users find specific geological data and locations of interest.

### Geological Reports:
- Allow users to generate reports and presentations based on their geological research and findings.
- Include customizable templates for reports.

### Collaboration and Sharing:
- Enable collaboration between geologists by allowing them to share maps, data, and findings.
- Implement user accounts and permissions for collaboration features.

### Educational Resources:
- Include educational content, such as articles, videos, and tutorials, to help users learn about geological concepts and techniques.

### Customizable Preferences:
- Allow users to customize the app's appearance, including choosing map themes (e.g., satellite view, topographic view) and color schemes.

### Notifications and Alerts:
- Implement notifications and alerts for geological events, research updates, and data availability.

### Offline Access:
- Enable offline access to geological maps and data for fieldwork in remote areas.

### Data Export:
- Provide options for exporting geological data, maps, and reports in various formats (e.g., PDF, CSV, GeoJSON).

### Security and Data Privacy:
- Ensure data security and user privacy by implementing proper authentication and access control measures.

### Mobile Compatibility:
- Create a responsive design that works well on both desktop and mobile devices to facilitate fieldwork.

### Integration with External Tools:
- Integrate with GIS (Geographic Information System) software and other geological analysis tools.

### Feedback and Support:
- Include a feedback mechanism for users to report issues and request assistance.
